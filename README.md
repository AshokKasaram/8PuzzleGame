## 8PuzzleGame

### Introduction
Welcome to the **8-Puzzle Solver** project! This repository showcases a Flask-based web application that scrambles user-uploaded images into an 8-puzzle. The application highlights my expertise in applying advanced AI algorithms and software engineering principles to create interactive, user-friendly tools.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Image Scrambling**: Users can upload any image, which is dynamically split into a 3x3 grid to form a unique, challenging puzzle.
- **AI-Powered Solving Mechanism**: Incorporates an A* search algorithm enhanced with the Manhattan Distance heuristic to efficiently calculate the minimum moves required to solve the puzzle.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Developed using Flask, the interface provides a seamless interaction experience, allowing users to engage directly with the puzzle.
- **Adaptive Layout**: Designed to be fully responsive, ensuring smooth operation across different devices and screen sizes.

### Technical Highlights
- **Algorithm Implementation**: At the core of this project is the A* search algorithm, renowned for its effectiveness in pathfinding and graph traversals.
- **Heuristic Strategy**: Utilizes Manhattan Distance to optimize the estimation of moves required to reach the goal state, thereby speeding up the solving process.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Demonstrates comprehensive development capabilities with backend logic in Python/Flask and frontend implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
