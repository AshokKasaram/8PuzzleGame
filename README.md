8-Puzzle Solver: Advanced AI Algorithm Implementation
Welcome to my 8-Puzzle Solver project! This repository contains a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload an image, which is then scrambled into an 8-puzzle. The project showcases my ability to apply complex algorithms and software engineering principles to develop interactive tools.

Key Features
Dynamic Image Scrambling: Users can upload any image, which is then dynamically split into a 3x3 grid to create a unique puzzle.
AI-Powered Solving Mechanism: Implements an A* search algorithm with the Manhattan Distance heuristic to efficiently find the minimum number of moves required to solve the puzzle.
Interactive Web Interface: Built with Flask, the application provides a seamless user experience, allowing real-time interaction with the puzzle.
Adaptive Layout: Features a responsive design that adapates to various device screens, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.

Technical Highlights
Algorithm Implementation: The core of this project is the A* search algorithm, known for its efficiency and accuracy in pathfinding and graph traversals.
Heuristic Functionality: Utilizes Manhattan Distance to estimate the number of moves to reach the goal state, enhancing the algorithm's performance.
Full-Stack Development: Integrates both backend logic in Python with Flask and frontend technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating a well-rounded full-stack development skill set.
